## üß© How It Works

Instafication uses a simple browser-based approach:

1. You run a small code snippet in your browser console while on Instagram
2. This code extracts the usernames of people you follow and who follow you
3. You paste this data into Instafication
4. Our algorithm compares the lists to find users who don't follow you back
5. Results are displayed instantly in your browser

## ‚ùì FAQ

### Is this tool safe to use?
Yes, Instafication is completely safe. The tool runs entirely in your browser and doesn't store any of your Instagram data. Your information never leaves your computer.

### Why do I need to use the console?
Instagram doesn't provide a public API for this kind of data. The console code simply extracts the usernames that are already visible on your screen.

### Do I need to log in to use this tool?
No login is required for Instafication itself. You just need to be logged into your Instagram account when you run the console code.

### I'm not getting any results or the results seem incomplete. What should I do?
Make sure you've scrolled all the way down in both your followers and following lists before running the code. Instagram loads users dynamically as you scroll.

### How accurate is this tool?
The tool is as accurate as the data you provide. If you don't scroll to load all followers/following, the results will be incomplete. For the most accurate results, make sure to scroll through both lists completely before running the code.

### Why is Instafication better than other unfollower tools?
Unlike many other tools that require you to provide your Instagram login credentials (which can be risky), Instafication works with data you extract yourself while already logged in. This means your password stays private and secure. Plus, we don't store any of your data on our servers - everything happens right in your browser.

## üöÄ Troubleshooting

### Console Error: "allow pasting" not working
Try typing `allow pasting` exactly as shown (with a space) and press Enter. If that doesn't work, try refreshing the page and trying again.

### Empty Results
Make sure you've scrolled to load ALL followers/following. Instagram loads them as you scroll. Try scrolling up and down several times to ensure everything is loaded.

### Can't Copy the Results
After running the code, right-click on the array that appears in the console and select "Copy object". If that option doesn't appear, try clicking on the array first to select it.

### Instagram UI Changed
If Instagram updates their UI, our code might need updating. Check back for updates or contact us through GitHub if you notice the tool isn't working.
